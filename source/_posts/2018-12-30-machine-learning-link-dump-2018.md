title: Machine Learning Link Dump 2018
---

This was a great year for machine learning, the amount of content produced about data is overwhelming, to try to keep up, I follow people on Twitter, participate on ML groups on telegram, subscribe to newsletters, podcasts and so on, so I open a lot of links every day, and some of them are very worth going back to.

Because of those many sources, I don't have a centralized way of knowing what I read, so I decided to take a data mining approach to it: I got the links from my tweets, articles sent to kindle, YouTube history, newsletter emails and todo lists, and dumped here.

Most of the links are content created on 2018, some are much older, but I just came across them this year. I did this for myself as I will go back to those links from time to time, but I hope it can be useful to you as well!
